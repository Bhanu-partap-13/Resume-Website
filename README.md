# :sparkling_heart: Support the project

I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use the `Resume` for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:

*   Giving proper credit when you use it, linking back to it. :D
*   Starring and sharing the project. :rocket:

Thanks! :heart:
